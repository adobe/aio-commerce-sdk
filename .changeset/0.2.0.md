Introduces the `aio-commerce-lib-core` package, which contains core utilities for the AIO Commerce SDK. It includes:

- A `Result` type based on Rust's `Result` type, to do better error handling.
- A set of validation utilities, including pretty printing of validation errors, and custom validation error types.
- Refactor aio-commerce-lib-auth to use aio-commerce-lib-core

Implements validation for the `aio-commerce-lib-auth` operations via `valibot`.
