Defined in: [aio-commerce-lib-app/source/actions/association/index.ts:26](https://github.com/adobe/aio-commerce-sdk/blob/71bf66656ef1fc6dd272a0821e8b00aab5dc197e/packages/aio-commerce-lib-app/source/actions/association/index.ts#L26)

Factory to create the route handler for the `association` action.

The `association` action manages the lifecycle of the Commerce instance the
app is associated with — `POST /` stores the data when the app is associated,
and `DELETE /` clears it on unassociation. Runtime actions consume the data
via `getCommerceInstance` / `getCommerceClient` from the root entrypoint.

## Returns

(`params`: `RuntimeActionParams`) => `Promise`\<`ActionResponse`\>
